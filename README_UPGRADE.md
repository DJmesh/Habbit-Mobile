# Upgraded to Expo SDK 54 (by ChatGPT)

Your device has Expo Go for **SDK 54**, so this project was bumped to Expo SDK 54 to avoid the "Project is incompatible with this version of Expo Go" error.

## What was changed
- `expo` -> `~54.0.0`
- `babel-preset-expo` -> `~13.0.0` (in devDependencies)
- `expo-location` -> `~18.1.6`
- Ensured `@babel/core` is present
- Kept `babel.config.js` using `presets: ['babel-preset-expo']`

> Note: Exact peer versions (React/React Native, other Expo packages) should be aligned automatically with the command below.

## How to finish the upgrade
From the project root run:
```bash
# clean first if needed
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json yarn.lock pnpm-lock.yaml

# install and align to Expo 54-compatible versions
npm install
npx expo install --fix
npx expo doctor --fix

# start
npx expo start -c
```

If you still have Expo Go 53 installed on your phone, update it to the latest from the store.
If you must stay on SDK 53 instead, use the other zip I provided earlier (or ask me to generate a 53-targeted build) and install **Expo Go for SDK 53** on your device.
